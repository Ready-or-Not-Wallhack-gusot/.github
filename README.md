## Overview

Ready or Not’s heart-pounding realism means one wrong guess and you’re chalk. This wallhack overlays color-coded silhouettes and bounding boxes through every opaque surface, giving you real-time intel before you breach or clear. By fusing a **stealth injector engine** with kernel-level spoofing, it keeps anticheat scanners staring at blank sheets. No glitchy textures, no lag spikes—just clean vision and ruthless efficiency.

## Why Our Wallhack Obliterates the Competition 💥

Most ESP mods spray cheap draw calls that scream “cheat” at the kernel watcher. Ours spawns a **ghost overlay layer** inside a sandboxed process, hashing render signatures every frame. That means frame-perfect silhouettes without raising a single heuristic flag. Couple that with distance-based dimming and you’ll look like a tactical genius, not a blatant wall-starer.
